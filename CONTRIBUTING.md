## Development Setup

**Fork the repo and clone your fork:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/frontend.git
   ```

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
**Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```
**Run the development server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```
The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173/` (*or as specified in your terminal*).

## Branching Strategy
main â†’ stable, production-ready code

dev â†’ active development

Feature branches should be named:

```arduino
feature/short-description
fix/short-description
docs/short-description
```

## Testing
We expect contributions to include tests where appropriate.

Run the test suite with:

```bash
npm test
```

*Add new tests for new features or bug fixes.*

## Code Style
Use Prettier for formatting.

Follow React + TypeScript best practices (if TS is used).

Keep components small, composable, and readable.

## Submitting a Pull Request
Make sure your branch is up to date with dev.

Ensure tests pass and code is formatted.

Open a pull request to dev with:

A clear title (e.g., feat: add new telemetry graph)

A description of changes and related issues.

## Community Guidelines
Be respectful and constructive.

Keep discussions technical and helpful.

Remember: Gauge is open-source, but safety-critical decisions always require professional diagnostics.
